Biochemical Network Tutorial
============================

Source:  https://github.com/mic-pan/BGT_BiochemicalNetworkTutorials

This tutorial deals with the creation and simulation of biochemical networks using bond graphs. In this tutorial, we will use the BondGraphTools package to:
- create and simulate bond graph models of biochemistry
- use chemical reaction networks to generate bond graph models
- extract efforts and flows from a bond graph to calculate reaction fluxes and affinities
- use bond graphs to represent an existing model of a transporter
